# UNutrition App Backend

> This project enables the automatic webscraping of UMass Dining services, the storage of the resultant data with MongoDB.
## Check out the main IOS app [HERE](https://github.com/natepl/hackUMassApp).

### Description
Welcome to our contribution to HackUmass XII! On this page is all of the work we've done to build a system that can use the nutritional information provided by [UMass Dining](https://umassdining.com/locations-menus) to guide students to choose foods in a more healthy and sustainable way. 

It's easy to be paralized by choice with how much food is available on campus, so why not set your preferences and goals and let our app narrow down what you might like to eat!


#### Installation
The source code stored on this page isn't meant to be used client-side, instead check out the [ios app](https://github.com/natepl/hackUMassApp) to see our project in action.
